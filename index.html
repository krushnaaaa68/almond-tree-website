      <p>
        The <strong>Almond Tree</strong> (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>), commonly called 
        <strong>Badam</strong> in Hindi, is a medium-sized deciduous tree belonging 
        to the <strong>Rosaceae</strong> family. Famous for its edible seeds, almonds 
        are one of the most popular and nutritious nuts in the world. The almond tree 
        is native to the Middle East and South Asia but is now cultivated globally in 
        warm, dry climates such as <strong>California</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong>, and 
        <strong>India</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The almond tree typically grows 4â€“10 meters tall and blooms in late winter or 
        early spring, producing clusters of fragrant pinkish-white flowers before 
        its leaves appear. The seeds (almonds) are enclosed within a hard shell, 
        which is further surrounded by a green hull.
      </p>

      <p>
        Almonds are a <strong>superfood</strong> rich in healthy fats, proteins, fiber, 
        vitamins, and minerals. They are widely used in sweets, milk, bakery products, 
        and cosmetic industries. In Ayurveda and Unani medicine, almonds are 
        recommended for improving memory, skin health, and overall strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        Culturally, almonds are associated with <strong>prosperity, wisdom, and health</strong>. 
        They are often given as gifts during festivals and weddings, symbolizing good 
        fortune and happiness.
